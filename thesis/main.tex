\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

To understand the complex interactions in modern software, engineers often rely on detailed
\textit{high-fidelity telemetry} (HFT) data collected via instrumentation tools injected into the
kernel. Increasingly, developers have turned to eBPF (the extended Berkeley Packet Filter) for HFT
data collected, as it provides an extensible framework for high performance, low overhead
instrumentation. However, due to the eBPF's nascent, ever-evolving, and complex infrastructure,
developers often end up resorting to simple but inefficient programs, or a limited set of tools from
existing libraries.

% However, developers wishing to write eBPF programs immediately
% face significant obstacles: the
% ecosystem is volatile and constantly evolving, the documentation
% can be sparse or outdated, and
% developers must have a deep knowledge of not only the internal
% eBPF system architecture, but
% also the kernel tracing infrastructure and generally the kernel
% development environment. As a
% result, tracing programs are often simple and/or inefficient,
% incurring unnecessary (and
% sometimes prohibitive) overhead, and developers frequently resort
% to existing libraries like
% \texttt{bcc}/\texttt{bpftrace} that provide a limited set of
% tools.

We introduce eBQL, a novel eBPF streaming query engine that enables performant HFT data collection
via an expressive, high-level interface. eBQL provides a familiar relational layer over existing
kernel tracing infrastructure, allowing developers to query arbitrary kernel events with minimal
overhead. Internally, eBQL processes SQL queries into an abstract syntax tree (AST), analyzes and
optimizes the AST, then generates an eBPF program to execute the query, streaming output via a
structured schema definition.

We evaluate eBQL-generated eBPF programs on a RocksDB case study simulating a real-world workload.
eBQL queries incur a minimal abstraction overhead versus hand-optimized queries ($3.2\%$ vs.
$1.7\%$), and offer a $5-8\times$ performance improvement over a baseline eBPF program.

\section{Future Work}

eBQL is still a prototype; there is much future work left to explore.

We have shown that performing as much aggregation and filtering in kernel space significantly lowers
overhead by reducing the amount of data transmitted between to user space (\S \ref{perf-drilldown}).
Cost-based analysis and optimizations provide an opportunity to further develop this research: as
recent work starts to quantify performance characteristics (ref: in-kernel traffic sketching) and
latencies of specific BPF routines (ref: BPF runtime policy), it would be interesting to produce a
cost estimate based not on disk IO cost (as in traditional DBMSs), but rather specific BPF routines,
like kernel memory accesses or hash map iterations. Further, since BPF programs are executed
continuously, there is potential to gather statistics on data characteristics and use runtime flags
to dynamically enable/disable operators.

These cost-based optimizations become increasingly important as the Linux kernel supports more
features and gradually removes BPF restrictions. For instance, Linux v5.17 introduces an arbitrary
\texttt{bpf\_loop} that relaxes loop restrictions (ref: bpf-loop kernel patch), and Linux 6+
introduces \texttt{kfunc}s and non-BPF-map based data structures like linked lists and red-black
trees, opening the floor for performant dynamic memory (ref: kfuncs, rb trees). With these
constructs, joins can become feasible in kernel space, and so cost analysis to minimize tail
latencies becomes even more pertinent.

eBQL also adopts a relatively simple streaming approach that contains opportunities for
sophistication. Although BPF functions are event-based and thus cannot be manually scheduled, there
is opportunity to share synopses between multiple queries (e.g. if separate developers are querying
the same tracepoint), and there are various probabilistic sketch algorithms for efficient sub-linear
approximations that can be exploited. For instance, (ref: in-kernel traffic sketching) contains an
implementation of the count-min sketch; it would be interesting to investigate the performance and
\textit{feasibility} of other sketches, like HyperLogLog, Theta Sketches, and the t-digest/q-digest
for quantiles.

\section{Conclusion}

eBQL is an eBPF streaming query engine that facilitates performant HFT data collection via an
expressive interface, exposing a familiar relational layer over existing kernel tracing
infrastructure. eBQL eases the burden of understanding internal kernel/BPF infrastructure and
developing custom BPF programs, making low-overhead HFT data collection accessible to application
developers.
